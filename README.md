The purpose of a joke is to make people laugh, often by poking fun at something in a light-hearted and non-malicious way. A jokes app is a software application designed for entertainment purposes that provides users with a collection of jokes and humorous content. These apps typically feature different categories of jokes, such as puns, one-liners, knock-knock jokes, and more.
